Fibonacci Sequence and Prime Numbers

This script demonstrates various operations related to the Fibonacci sequence and prime numbers.

Functions:
- is_prime(num): Checks if a number is prime.
- fibonacci_sequence(n): Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
- count_primes_in_sequence(sequence): Counts the number of prime numbers in a given sequence.
- calculate_primes_in_fibonacci(n): Calculates the prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
- plot_fibonacci_sequence(n): Plots the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
- plot_fibonacci_spiral(sequence): Plots the Fibonacci sequence as a spiral.
- main(): The main function that executes the program.

Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to generate.
3. The script will display the following:
   - The Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
   - The number of prime numbers in the sequence.
   - The prime numbers in the sequence.
4. The script will then plot two graphs:
   - A line plot of the Fibonacci sequence.
   - A spiral plot of the Fibonacci sequence.

Dependencies:
- matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs.
- numpy: Used for mathematical operations and generating arrays.

Note:
- The script assumes that the user will input a valid positive integer for the number of Fibonacci terms.
- If an invalid input is provided, the script will prompt the user to enter a valid integer.
- The script uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime.
- The `count_primes_in_sequence` function counts the number of prime numbers in a given sequence.
- The `calculate_primes_in_fibonacci` function calculates the prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- The `plot_fibonacci_sequence` function plots the Fibonacci sequence as a line plot.
- The `plot_fibonacci_spiral` function plots the Fibonacci sequence as a spiral.

Example:
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms: 10
Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
Number of prime numbers in the sequence: 3
Prime numbers in the sequence: [2, 3, 5]

The script will then display two plots:
1. A line plot of the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
2. A spiral plot of the Fibonacci sequence, where the radius is the square root of the sequence values.

The is_prime function checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number.
If any number in that range divides the given number evenly, it is not prime.

The fibonacci_sequence function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms using a while loop.
It starts with the initial values a=0 and b=1, and appends a to the sequence in each iteration.
Then, it updates a and b according to the Fibonacci formula: a, b = b, a + b.

The count_primes_in_sequence function takes a sequence of numbers and counts the number of prime numbers in it.
It iterates over each number in the sequence and uses the is_prime function to check if the number is prime.
If a number is prime, the count is incremented.

The calculate_primes_in_fibonacci function calculates the prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
It first generates the Fibonacci sequence using the fibonacci_sequence function.
Then, it uses a list comprehension to filter out the prime numbers from the sequence.

The plot_fibonacci_sequence function plots the Fibonacci sequence as a line plot using matplotlib.
It takes the number of terms n as input, generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms,
and plots the sequence against the term numbers.

The plot_fibonacci_spiral function plots the Fibonacci sequence as a spiral using matplotlib.
It takes the Fibonacci sequence as input and calculates the angles and radius for each term.
The angles are evenly spaced from 0 to 2Ï€ times the number of terms.
The radius is calculated as the square root of the sequence values.
The spiral is plotted using the calculated angles and radius.

The main function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms,
validates the input, and then calls the respective functions to generate the sequence, count prime numbers,
calculate prime numbers in the sequence, and plot the graphs.

This script provides a comprehensive demonstration of working with the Fibonacci sequence, prime numbers,
and visualizing the sequence using line plots and spirals.

"""
Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

Parameters:
    n (int): The number of terms to generate in the Fibonacci sequence.

Returns:
    list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

Description:
    This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms. The Fibonacci sequence
    is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the
    previous two numbers.

    The function uses a while loop to generate the sequence. It starts with the initial
    values a=0 and b=1, and appends a to the sequence in each iteration. Then, it updates
    a and b according to the Fibonacci formula: a, b = b, a + b. The loop continues until
    the length of the sequence reaches n.

    Finally, the function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence as a list.

Example:
    >>> fibonacci_sequence(7)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

    >>> fibonacci_sequence(10)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

Note:
    - The function assumes that n is a non-negative integer.
    - If n is 0, the function will return an empty list.
    - If n is 1, the function will return [0].
    - If n is 2, the function will return [0, 1].

Count the number of prime numbers in a given sequence.

Parameters:
    sequence (list): A sequence of numbers.

Returns:
    int: The count of prime numbers in the sequence.

Description:
    This function takes a sequence of numbers as input and counts the number of prime numbers
    present in the sequence. It iterates over each number in the sequence and uses the `is_prime`
    function to check if the number is prime. If a number is prime, the count is incremented.
    Finally, the function returns the total count of prime numbers in the sequence.

Example:
    >>> sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> count_primes_in_sequence(sequence)

Note:
    The function assumes the existence of an `is_prime` function that takes a number as input
    and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.
